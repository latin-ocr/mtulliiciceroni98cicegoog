“ Ye percsive how Pliny teaeheth, that by this exercise cf·
double translating, is learned easily, sensibly, hy little and little,
uct only all the hard congruities of grammar, the choice oi=¹
aptent words, the right framing of words, and sentences, come-
liness oi ligures, and forms fit for every matter, and proper ior
every tangue: hut that which is greater also, in marking daily,
and following diligently thus the steps oi the beat authors, like
invention cl arguments, like order in disposition, like utterance
in elocution is easily gethered upa whereby your scholar shall
he brought not only to like eloquente, but also to' all true under-
standing andright judgment, both for writing end speaking.
' And where Dionysius Halicarnasseeus heth written two excellent
books, the ono De Delectu Optimcrum Verborum, (the which, I
sear, is lost) the other, of the right framing of words and sen-
tences, which doth romain yet in Greek, to the great proiit of
all them that truly study eloquence: yet this way of double
translating, shall bring the whole profit oi both these books to a
diligent scholar, and that easily and pleasantly, both for fit choice
of words, und apt composition of sentences.

“ And by these authorities and reasons am 1 moved to think
this way oi double wenslating, either only, or chiefly, to he
tittest for the speedy and perfect attaining oi any tongue.
And for speedy attaining, I durat venture a good vager, if a
scholar, in whom is aptness, love, diligenoe, and constanoy,
would hut translate after this sort, one little book in 'fully (as De
Senectute, with two Epistles, the first, Ad Q. Fratrem, the other,
Ad Lentulum, the last save one in the first book) that scholar,
1 say, should come to a better knowledge in the Latin tongue,
than the most part do, that spend four or live years in tossing
all the rules of grammar in common schools. indeed this one
book with these two epistles is not sufficient to afford ell Latin
words (which is not necessary for a young scholar to know) hut

stands in Pliny, end he suggests that he trusted to hls memory. There isa
curicus difference in the first part oi the passage as quoted hy Aseham:
“Utile ln primis, nt multi praecipiunt, ex Graeco in Iatinum etex latino
vertere in Graecum.” Pliny certainly does not in plain terma recommend
double translation3 hut a translation from Latin hy a &man into Greek
would clearly be sn exercise of little use, unless the neurim had a Greek
original to compare his translation with.
