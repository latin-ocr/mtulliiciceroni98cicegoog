PREFACE. xiii

but tbe memory of boys is the chief faculty to be used when
they are young, and they will get through thie lebour in a
reasonable time. It is however necessary that a teacher should
avoid the common error of making boys decline noune with
what are called the signs oi the cases; ior if thie is done, the
boy will lesrn something that be will afterwards bave to
unlearn3 and it is a good principle in teuching, that a child
should have no error implanted in him, it ve can help it. What
isfirst lixed, whether right or wrong, is very difficolt to eradi-
cate. Iu learning the conjugatione also the usual sigua or trans·
latione should be avoided, as they lead to erroneous notious,
particularly in the subjunctive meod. The method adopted in
Professor Key's Grammar, is that of conjugating the verbs in
connexion with some other Latin words, so as to form a short
sentence, of which a translation is given. This method is free
from all objection : the boy learns the meaning oi the tenses in
connexion with other words, and at the same time he begins to
get a small vocabulary.

As to the eight parts of speech, as Ascbam calls them, there
is no use in telling a boy the names ol a number of things before
he sees them. He cannot eomprehend what a preposition is till
he sees it used. When he learns the forms ot noune, adjectives,
and verbs, he will also leern their names, and he may defer
learning the names of tbe other parts ot speech till he meets with
them.

The next thing to leam according to Ascham, is ‘¹ the right
joining together of substantives with adjectivae, the noun with
the verb, the relative with tbe antecedent,'’ or the three eon-
cordances, as he calls them. There is only one way of learning
this, which is by examples from Latin authors; and a toacher

may find plenty of the simplest sentences in the best Latin
authors which will serve this purpose7. isay, “ in the best
Latin authors ;'' ior I‘would not have the master melre them him-
sels. He may select sor this purpose as many as he shall think
fit, which he must translate to the boy, and he must fully
explain every word. He must also translate the sentences in

⁷'l'be first book of Livy will supply abundares of examplas; or they
may be selected from Cicero witb little trouble.
