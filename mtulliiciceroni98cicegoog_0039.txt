xxxii ¹ PREFAOE.

with stops, end words which are closely connected in sense are
often separated in such a manner that a leamer does not see
ι their connexion. But when a man begins to atrike out the
points, he will often find that when he has got rid os one, he
must get rid of another, and then a third, so that many short
sentences will romain without any point; which however is no
disadvantage, but the contrary. A short sentence seldom re·
quires any points. ln the longer sentences it is necessary to
place some points to mark the chief pauses, which would be
made in reading them ; but they need not be many. ltmay be

Ι objected to the punctuation of this book, that itis not always

consistent3 but 1 hare preferred occasional inconsistency‚ or
apparent inconsistency‚ to the muel system of punctuation,
which itself bas not even the merit of consistency. Whatever
fault may be found with the punctuation of this boolr, a diligent
boy will understand Cicero better, as 1 have pointed the text,
than it' he reads it in the point-belabonred editions which are
commonly used. He will not fail in many cases to see the rela-
tion οἰ words to one another which in the ordinary texts is dis-
jointed by perplexing points.

The notes are mainly intended to explain the language. I
have attempted to explain the meaning of a iew single words,
which are either difficult or sometimes misunderstood; the
right placing of some words, which it is important to observe;
and the usage of those words, which chiefly serve to connect
the subordinate or dependent with the principal sentences. Ι
have not attempted to give reasons for certain forms ot' ex-
pression, for such reasons are generally very insufficient3 but
lhave attempted to show the logical structure of the sentence.

Those who have not been used to a critical study of Latin, may
perhaps be led to see how far a eareful study and comparison of
a small portion of one author, and that the bertin the Latin lan·
guage‚ will enable a student to mosteroli the ordinary forms oi
expression and to construet a sentence with accuraey. Aperson
will scarcely believe till he has tried the experiment‚ how much
citha language is contained in a single treatise, such as the De

Senectute. This small treatise alone, ifthoroughly mastered
on Ascham's plan, would make a man a good Latin scholar.
There are indeed many things which it does not taach h1m3
