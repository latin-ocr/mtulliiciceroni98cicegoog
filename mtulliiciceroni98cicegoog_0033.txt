“Here his wit shall be new seton work; his judgment, fot

exercised, than by learning any thing without the book; and
here how much hs heth protited‚ shall plainly appear. When

commend his good choice and right placing of words; show his
faults gently, but blame them not over sharply3 for of such

after groweth to perfectness, if this¹ order bs diligently used by
the scholar, and gently handled by the master. For here shall
all the hard points of grammar, both easily and surely be learned
up; which scholars in common schools, hy making of Latinas,
be groping at 'with care, and fesr, and yet in many years they
scarce can resch unto them ⁶.

“I remember when 1 was young, in the north they' went to
the grammar school little children; they came from thence
great lubbers, always learning, and little profiting; learning
without⁷ book every thing, understanding within the book little

over the exercises by himself marks the erreis, and returns to each boy hi
exorciso. Then he takes the original in his hand, and reads it over slowl
sentence by sentence before the class, remerking on any prevalent errore i
the exercitas, and commenting on any peculiarity in the 00010000. Th
boys take down the Latin on paper, which is itself a good exorciso, en
when it is done he calls on one or two at hasard to read it out cloud. Th
boys are recommended to read it over afterwards two or three times. A

book ont of which alone they can leam, the author. Working at Ellis
Exercises is learning “without book.'' cr “ meet toil without order.'’
