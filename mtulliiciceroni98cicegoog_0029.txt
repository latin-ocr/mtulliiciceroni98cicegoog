studento, who are bent upon learning. Boys will do very little ¹,
that they are not required to do. Still it will be a very usefrrl ,3
exercise ιο require the boys, when they have thoroughly mas- ,
tered a Latin lesson, to read over the Latin aloud and with proper
emphasis, so that the master may judge whether they fully Α
understand the lesson as they read it. indeed it is not too ,

much to require of boys, who have gone once through the first ,
book of Caesar's Gallio war, to commit to memory ten or a ,
dozen chapters, so asto be able to deliver them orally without s
any fault Such a practice, combined with the remarks of the ,
master on the order of the words in the daily lessous, will form Ἴ
the ear of the boy ιο a right order, and lay the foundation of a ,

round knowledge cf the form of a sentence. However much ,
boys may fail, under the usual system, in the right construction Ἴ
of a sentence and the ordering of words, it is certain that they ,
may attain a green proliciency in both by this practice, simply ,
by the exercite of the ear; and they may become tolerably γ
expertia this part of the iangnagc before they have attained a i
correspondent skill in the right choise ol words, et least of any
other than the ordinary words. For the perfect choica of right
words only comes with riper years and much careful reading; as 2
any man may convince himself hya little consideration. The
proper choico of words ιο denote abstract terma and terme of
art is learned slowly and with much labour. In fact it is the y
part of a language which is learned last. t
If we consider the power which the Latin language has in ,
varying the order of words in a sentence, so as ιο express hythe ἒ
same words, differently placed, different chades of meaning, we
must admit that the order of the words is as much a matter of
careful observation from the first, aa any thing else. What
would be thought ofa German teccher who should not from the
first make his pupil ohserve the differenee between the English
and the German ordesl Or we may take another example from
the Italian language, which has retained cll the force and vigour
of the Latin, aud acquired powers unknown even to the parent
touguc. Bingioli in his Italian Grammar has given a good
example of an expression which can hs varied seven different
ways, each of which has a different meaning. It is this:
