l rent ιιι exercising paraphrasin and metaphrasin. Paraphrasis

is to take some eloquent oration, or some notable common· place

i inlatio, and express it with other words: metaphraeis' rs to

take some notable place out of a good poet, and turn the same
sense into matre, οι into other words in prose. Οιοιιιιι, οι
rather Tully, doth mislike both these ways5 because tbe author
either orator or poet, had chosen out before the fittest words,
and aptest composition for that metten and so he, in secking
other, was driven to use the worse.

“ Quintilian¹ also preferreth translation before all other exer·
oiaea; yet having a lust to dissent from Tully (as he doth in
very many places, if a man read his Rhetorick over advisedly;
aud that rather of au enricus mind, than of any just cause) doth
greatly commend paraphrasis, crossing spitefully Tully's judg·
ment in refusing the same; and so do Remus, and Tallaeus even
atthis day in Franco too. But such singularity in dissenting
from the best men's judgment, in liking only their own opinions,
ismuch misliked of all them, that join with learning, discretim,

Tacitus, nor yet his most excellent learned uncle, the elder
Plinius) doth express in an epistle to his friend Fuscus (vii. 9),

translation, aud preferreth it before all the rest. And because ’
