And why neti For it is read, that Dion Ptusseeus, thet nise
philosopher, and excellent crstourof all his time, did come to the
great learning and uttersnce thet was in him, by reading, end
following only two books, Phaedon Platonis, end Demosthenes’
most notable oration περι παραπρεσβείας.

“And a better end nearer example herein may be, our most
noble Queen Elisabeth, who never took yet Greek nor Letin
grammar in her hand, aiter the first decliuing oi a noun end a
verb; but only hy thie double translating ol Demosthenes end
Isocrates, deily, without missing, every forenoon, and likewise
some pert of Tully every aftemoon, sor the specs oi e year or
two, bath ettaimd ιο such a perfect understanding in both the
tongues, and tc such e ready utterance of the Latin, and thet
with such s judgment, es they be few iu number in both the
Universities, οι· elsewhere iu Englend, that be in both tongues
comperable with her Mejesty ⁴. And to conclude in sebert

daily merhing, first, the cause end metter; then, the words end
phrases, next the order end composition; efter, the resson and
arguments; theu, the forms end figures oi both the tongues;

the author deth use, which is reed. And thus much for double
translatiou.”

methcd, or merely ior reading in the usual way, if a teacher
prefers it. The text of Orelli hes generally been followed, but
Orelli bas not given all the various readings which eu editor

would require, if his object were to establish the text according
to his own judgment. The punctuation of Latin books is diffi-
cult, eud it is impossible ιο ley down any generel mles. The
fault ol the common punctuation is that an author is overloaded
