myaelf do not adopt his principle ol tecching the en ῃ,

A boy who is taught on Mr. Robaon’s method would ba
taught well. His direct object ia not to teacb ayoung boy to
write Latin, but to give him the knowledge, which he must get
in some way, before he can commence reading a'Latin author.
For it is agreed among all sensible teachers, that a boy should
read some good Latin author as soon arbacen, Caesar for in·
stance, or parts ol Cicero. But it is not agreed which is the
cariest and cureat method ol giving a boy the knowledge which
ia necessary to enable him to read. I believe the best method
is not by writing Latin exercisea only, even if the exercises are
the best that can be made: and the reasons lor thia opinion,
auch as they are, may be collected from various parts of thia
preface; to which 1 could add others, if the object were to
write a dissertation. Το make the writing of Latin, especially
for young boys,a direct objectis one of the gross absurdities
ol modern teaching, only exceeded by the grosaness of the ma·
teriol, which is produced and called Latin prose. Aa 1 have ex-
plained, I would malie a boy leam his Latin author both ways,
from Latin into English, and from English into Latin, in order
that he may know both sides of it. In thia way he will acquire
aconsiderable iacility ot' rendering English into Latin, without
acquiring a facility in writing bad latin, which, according to
