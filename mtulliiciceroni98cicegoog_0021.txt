such way that the order of the English worda shall correspond
to the Latin, as far as the two idiome will allow, which in such
simple sentences will generally not be difficult; but when thia
cannot be done, the teachcr must give the meaning of the whole
Latin sentence in good plain English, without regardiug the
differenca in the order of the words in the two languages,and
be must help the boy in the matter by sully explaining the
several words and their relation ιο one another⁸. Ii he once
leta the boy begin ιο arrange the Latin words in a new order,
he has demaged tbe foundation oi hia knowledge, he has intro-
duced him to “a wrong placing of worda,¹' which is just aa
injurians in tha teacbing of Latin, aa il s teacber ol Freneh or
any modern lenguage should let hia pupils neglect the right

“placing of words.'' Two or three sentences st first will be 1
enough for a lesson, on which the boys will be examined by the
master, and will porse every·word.= Bnt this io not all ; every l
boy must learn ιο give the Latin back orally for the English,
and must also write it ou paper when the master gives out the ἷ
English. Thus he will learn it both ways. All thathelearns ,
will be true. He will acquire a great number oi words, and a ¹
knowledge oi bis three conoordances. ll the master has done
bis duty by interpreting the ,short sentences aright, the boy will
have acquired, so sar aa he bas gone, a right choice of words,
end a right placing of tham. So sar, if the work isdnne well, all
isclear gaiu; and the boy has got nothing thetis not worth
keepin .

Onagof the chief difficulties ol the Latin langusge is the right
nse os the pronouns and the propositione. Now it is easy ιο
select simple sentences, in which the principal uses ol the pro- ’

⁸ As tha toacher will have aomo way ol' tmnalating, which ιο will con-
sider to ιο ιιο right wey, itis plain that ha must teacb the boy what thia
way ia; for tbo boy knows no way till he bas either been taught nne by hia
master, or has found out one for himself, which is more likely tn ιο wrong
than right. The picking out of tha Latinworda and arranging them in
tha English order, cannot ιο too much condemned. 'ibose who object to
tho method hare recommendet, and would call it taking worda in tho
lump, would do well ιο remember that thera is both awrong and aright
way of taking worda in the lump. Thone who do not know how ιο do it

must not quarrel with those who do.
