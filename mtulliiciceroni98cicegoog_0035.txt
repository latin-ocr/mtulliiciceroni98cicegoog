‚xxviii PEEEAOE.

Antony Deny's, in Cheston. John Whitney‚ a young gentleman,
was my bedfellow: who willing by good nature, and provoked
by mine advice, began ιο learu the Latin tongue after the order
declared in this book. We began after Christmas; 1 read unto
him Tully de Amicitia, which he did every day twice translate,
out of Latin into English, and out of English into Latin a'gain.
About St. Laurence Tide after, to prove how he profited, I did
chuse out Torquatus' talk de Amicitia, in the latter end of the
first boolr De Finibus: because that place was the same in
matter, like in words and phrases, nigh ιο the form and fashion
of sentences, as he had learned before in De Amicitia. 1 did
translate it myself into plain English, and gave it him ιο tum
into Latin: which he did so choicely, so orderly, so without any
great miss in the hardest points of grammar, that some in seven

another, is either only, or at least chiefly< ιο be exercised
specially of youth, lor the ready aud sure obtaining of any
tangue-—

‘¹ Translation is easy in the beginning for the scholar, an:

lt is most common, and most commendable of all other exercise
for youth: most comm0n; for all your constructione in gramma*
schools be nothing else but translation: but because they be no
double translations, (as I do require‚) they bring forth but simpl
and single commodity; and because also they laclr the daily us
cf writing, which is the only thing that breedeth deep root, bot',
in the wit, for good understanding, and in the memory, for sur
lreepiug of all that ia learned: most commendabis also, and tha
by the judgment of all authors, which intreat of these exarcise:
Tully, in the person of L. Crassus, (whom he maketh his exempl
of eloquence and true judgment in learning) doth not onl
praise specially, and chuse this way of translation for a youn
