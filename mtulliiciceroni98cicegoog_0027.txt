carefnl teacber rnay add something ιο Ascham's method, or
slightly modily ic; but the principle uruat remain; which is
this: that the bey shall learn ιο construet Latin sentences by a
carclul smdy ol them in a Latin author, by the remarks of his
master, and by the imitation of rbem in rendering the English

back again into latin. lt will be usefral also when be proceeds
ιο subordinate or dependent sentences, aa be must do, when he
coures ιο read Caesar cr Cicero, lor the bey to have a good
grunw ιο refer ιο, in which some of the most important rules
are clearly laid down, or even a good exercise book. lt is
enough to remark, that many of the grammate in ordinary use
will not serve this purpose. ἵ
The more exact knowledge cl the Letin tongue is acquired by l
a careful reading ol the best writers, by which alone can be l
learned a right chcice ol words, a right placing of them⁸, end s
right framing ol a sentence. How absurd it is ιο expect boys to ¹
learn tha right framing cl a Latin sentence by the ordinary ι
system ol exercises, when they can hardly frama one in their l
own language correctly. Boys begin Latin very early, and so ι
early that it is necessary forthem to learn as much as ean be }
learned ol the language in the way that is nearest ιο the best
mode of learning a modern language, that is, by imitation. Aa
they advance in years and in understanding under the care of a
good macher, they begin ιο examine it critically. Itis quite
possible lora young boy ιο acquire a considerable facility'in
the Latin language, before he is able ιο examine the construction χ
el a sentence with much nicety. Indead if we consider the
early age at which Latin ie began, the great waste ol time arrd
'the batesul nature of the labour, cn the common system, it
would seem ιο be a better thing lor him-te learn a modern lan-

θ Α singular method ol tecching the right placing ol words is used in
Ellis's Latin Exercises, and thus explained in the preface: “ The Second
Part contains the principal rules ol syntax, with short examplcs ιο them,
the Latin words to which correspond in their arrangement with the
English; vvith sn intention that the scholar should, under bis master's
direction, endeavour gradually to place them in the Latin crder.'' He is
to be accustomed to what is wrong, end must gradually endeavour to cor-
rect his error; and by a like reason, he must be accustomed to any other ,
bad bebit, and murt gradually endeavour to correct it.
