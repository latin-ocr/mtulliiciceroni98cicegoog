ι dare clear, direct way to an improvement in our classical studies
a ’ is to abendon the ordinary making of ‘Latines3’ to adopt
Ascham's plan as soon as the boy is prepared for it, and to con-
sider well how he should be so prepared; for thet is really the
only rnatter iu disputa among good teachers. Further, to aban·
don all books of exercises which abound in multitudinous rules 3
and fragmentary exercises; to choose as a hoolr of rules to refer ,
a boy to (lorI do not reject generalitatione, but only the mode l
ol using them), one which is plain and simple, with plenty of ³
good examples well hanalated, whether such boolr be a gram- l
mar, or some well arranged system of rules with both examples
and exercises; andasta the endless niceties and curiosities of a
language, to trust to careful reading and a good teocher, lor
they cannot be learned by rules. If I recommend Ascham's
method, it is not that boys may learn to write Latin; it is that =
they may learu to read it and understand a Latin author well. ’
But at the same tima, l shall observe, by way oi meeting the
objection of those who are so mightily concerned about young
boys learning to write Latin, as ii tha thing were possible, that
l expect a pupil, who has been trained in the way which l sug-
gest, and has been saved from the exercite system, though he is
uot proiesaing to learn to write Latin, to write it better than the
boy who has been learning to write bad Latin: and ii a pupil
sc trained, as it is here recommended, chooses to use his own ¹

diligence‚ when ha has attaiued proper years, he shall with
reasonable pains write Latin with ease, ae well as it can be ¹
written now-a-days. For l maintain that the writing oi Latin ¹
well, ii that is the object proposed, can only be attaiued by a

student who has already made considerable progress in the lan·
guage, and has reached to years of understanding; and that the
