exercise, when it is at first limited, as it is almost necessarily, to
the forms oi simple sentences.

We now suppose the boy far enough advanced ιο proceed on

Aacham’s method‚ which requires little comment. 'l'he master
must “ read unto him ” the Latin author: the boy must not be
set to learn his lesson hy the aid of a dictionary. Ascham
mentione no dictionary: possibly there was not one at that time,
which was arrited to boys: and it would ba mnch better if there
were none at present to put into boys' hands, when wa consider
what they are. A good dictionsry is a necessary help, when
the hoy has made some progress ; and the master wants it too. A
bad one, used from the beginning,is an insuperabls impediment
to learning.

There, are many of Cicero's epistles to his different friends,
which are well adopted to the capacity ot' boys; and Stnrmins
did good service in selecting such for the capacity of children.
But the toacher must explain the cpistles first, as Ascham directs;
or he may take Caesar's Gallio war, hut let him at first omit the
speechea. Itis the teacher's business to explain ench an author
to the boys: itis not his business to bear how they have mis·
understood it after hard lnbonr⁴ with the dictionary. ln old
times the teachers taught; now it is a common practice tolet
boys learn wrong, iu order that they may be set right. But
boys keep in their head more of their own blundering than of
the master’s correction; and so they learn much that they must
afterwards nnlearn. Let then the macher exponnd the lesson
fully to a boy, leading him to a right choica of English words,
and a correct arrangement of them, avoiding all transposition
oi the Latin in translathrg, and taking it portion by portion, as
it hange together in the original, a clear, compact, and con·

sistent whole. Hewill have to say much on the several words

ior the lull explanation of them; bnt each integral part of a

sentence must be translated as a whole; and the difficulty that

aboy may have about the several words and their order must ba
removed by caresul parting and explanation. The Latin text
isthe matter which the teacher basto work upon ι and it is not
thoronghly mastered until the boy can render the Latin into
English, or give the Latinior the English indifferently. Δ
