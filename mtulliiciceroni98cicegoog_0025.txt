hoy must commit it to memory ¹. When the whole boolria read
in thia manner, the boy will be able to read it over again with-
out the previous explanation οι· the master, and with a little
help while he ia saying the lesson. Nor must the master chide
him, it he is diligent and does lrie beet, even if he fail sometimes.
“Il your scholar,'' says Aacham, “ do miss sometimes, ohide not l
hastily, tor that shall both dull his wit and discourage his l

diligence; but monish him gently, which shall melre him both
willing to amend and glad to go forward in love and hope ol ,
learning. Ihave now wished twice or thrice thie gentle nature 3
to he in a ach'oolmaster. And that 1 have done so, neither by

in mine opinion, love is fitter than sear, gentleness better than
hosting, to bring up a child rightly in lesming.” And so he
goes on ιο argue in lavour ol gentlenees in teaching, and ιο dis- ’

have ell faults rightly emended3 to have every vice severely
corrected: but for the order and way that leadeth rightly to
these points we somewhot differ.’' (Asoham.)

Itis the fashion in this country lor boys to write Latin verses
at every early age, to which, if the method be well conducted,
there is not the same objection as there is to their writing Latin
prose. The third book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, if vicli learned,
sill teach the boy the ‚structure of a Latin hexameter, and will
give him a fair stook of words. The practice of repeating the
same aloud vill form his ear to the verse, so that if the master
shall select easy hexameter lines out of Ovid, plainly turned into
English, and now and then supply a word, a boy will easily
restore the original hexameter, which generally is and always
should be nothing more than a simple proposition with some

memory passages from good authors. Cicero's recommendation was founded
on hie own practice: “ Exercenda eet etiam memoria ediscendis ad verbum
