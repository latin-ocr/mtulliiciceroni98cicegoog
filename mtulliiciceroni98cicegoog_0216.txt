CICERONIS EPISTOLARUM LIBRI DUO. 177

book is better adapted to learn the Latin language from
than any modern selection that I have seen3 auditis
very judiciously made. The first book contains fifty-seren
letters, most of them short; and very few present any
difficulty which a master cannot explain with little trouble.
Ihave placed in this first book of selectione the greater
part of those selected by Sturmius for his first book, to
which I have added a few others of the same kind. It
would not be difficolt to pick out about one hundred
short letters of this description, which, if well studied‚
would give a boy every competent knowledge of the con·

second book I have taken partly from the second and
third books of Sturmius, and partly I have selected them
myself, being guided in the choica by the judgment thet
Sturmius has shown. I wish that Icould have addeda
few more. This second book of letters is perhaps not
more diffieult than the first, except so far as greater

length may cause some trouble to beginners3 but many
of them are ofa different kind from the brief familiar

letters of the first book.

'Ibe Ziirich Letters (Second Series), edited for the ’
Perker Society hy the Rev. Η. Robinson, contain two
Latin letters of Ascham to J . Sturmius, and several from

others to Stsumius. 'Ihis series also contains some of Stur-
mius’ letters, two of which are to Elisabeth ; and there is
oue from Ehzabeth to sturmius, which is probably her
own. Another to Sturmius is signed I. Smith. One of
Aseham’s letters to Sturmius (Ep. xxx.) contains some
facts about the Quaen’s great readiness in Greek and
l Latin¹. These Zi'rrich letters, besides their historica]
