expedition (nc. 54), and landed with him at Deal on the
coaetos Kent.

Quintus wrote several letters to Marcus from Britain
(Ad Q. Fr. iii. 1 and 3). In the winter of this year
(no. 54) Quintus war with his legion in the country of
the Nervii, and he hravely defended his camp against ah
unexpected attach of the Gauls, until Caesar came to his
help (Caesar, De Bell. Gall. v. 39, dra). The extant
correspondence of Cicero with his brother does not ex·
tend beyond the time when he was quartered in the
country of the Nervii (Ad Q. Fr. iii. 8) ; but where the
country of the Nervii was, Marcus says that he does not
know. The subsequerlt history of Quintus is not material
for the present purpose. He perished in the proscrip-
tion with his brother rao. 43.

There are extant three books cf the letters of Marcus
tc Quintus. This, the iirst of the first book, is less of a
letter than an admonitory address. It has more of the

characteres Oicero’s oratorical writings than of his epis· ’

tolary correspondence‚ which is easily explained when we
see the nature of the subject. Quintus was governor of
Asia, the richest of the Roman provinces. We may col-

lect from the letter that he expected to stay only a year κ

in Asia3 but Marcus, aa the letter shows, had contrived
thet his brother should have two years, and it happened

that he stayed three. He gives some intimation of his ⁴
motives for this; he seems, as Siipfle says, to have wished
that his brother should make amends by a second year’s
probation for certain hasty proceedings and want of tem·
per in his first year. The object of the elder brother was
to maintain and strengthen his family in the high rank
to which he had raised it, and accordingly to make this
governorship of Asia honourable to Quintus and to himself.
