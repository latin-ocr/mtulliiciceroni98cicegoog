but those are either rare and peculias expressions, or words
which have a technical character, and belong to matters of con·
stitutional history, law, natural history, and the like. Afull
and exact knowledge of all, or even of the greater part of such
words ean only be learned by much reading; and even some of
the primary significations and nicer meaning· of words in
ordinary use can only be acquired by the student when he is
of riper years. But for a knowledge of the ordinary words of
the Latin language, their meaning, and the structure of a sen-
tence, a small portion of an author is sufficient3 nor can the
latin language be learned well, unless the foundation is laid in
some small portion ofa good author or two. When facility
of reading Latin has been obtained bya proper discipline,
aboy may read as much as the time will allow, and he may
direct his attention to the matteras wellas tc the language.
But it is a great error to introduce a boy to any author or part
of an author, where the matter is difficult, before he has ac·
quired a considerable fecility in the language; noris it any
answer to this objection that he may be helped with notes
and books of reference. Notes cannot in any reasonable space
explain every thing; and indeed they ought to be chiefly de·
signed for advanced studente and teachers3 they should rather
instruct by suggesting what a learner should look at, than by
aiming at complete exposition. Aa to making a boy use many
books of reference, either for matter geographical, historical, or
any other, there is great risk that he shall fall into the habit of¹
reading about his author cr the matter that is in him, instead
of studying the author himself. It is the teacher's business
tc supply all necessary explanation for beginners¹; and for this
reason, many notes are not required for young boys. As
already suggested, whati have done in these notes, has been
done with the view of aiding teachers and more advanced
studente, rather than for very young scholars. The reason why

which 1 have used. If a teacher has also the two Dictionaries edited by
Dr. Srnith, hc will find them useful. 1 make this general reference to
these works here, in order to srcid particular references in the notes and to
