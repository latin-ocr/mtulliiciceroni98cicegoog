gotten, and gotten only by imitation: ior as ys use ιο hear, so
ye learn to speak: if ye hear no other, ye specis not yoursell;
sod whom ye only hear, of them ye only learn.’' That which is
troc oi a living language is true of a dead one, oi “the Greek
and Latin tongues, the only two learned tongues, which be kept
notin common talk, but in private books.'' (Ascham.) A boy
who learns no Latin except good Latin, will know no other.
For this reason we would avoid the use oi any rules written in
Latin, many oi' which contain barbarous expressions3 and
though some oi these rules moy bs well enough in point oi
expression, it is pure waste oi time to fill a boy's head with
modern Latin, when there is so much better matter at hand to
fillitwish.

It is here urged theta boy should have none but the plainest
sentences, containing the simple proposition, laid before him, or
two such sentences united by a conjunction, until he has
obtained a good stocls oi words, and has fully mastered all these
simple sentences so ss to render the Latin into the English or
the English into the Latin indifferently. Above all, let the
teacher beware os perplexing him with subordinate or dependent
sentences, until this part is fully mastered. The sentences on
which he must be exercised should only contain the indicative
mood; but there are some sentences which contain only in-
dicative 'moods which must be excluded from this part ol his
discipline. How long it may take todo what ξε here proposed,
will depend on the diligenoe and ability oi the master; but it
will not be a work ol very long time; nor so irlrsome as tha
common method.

I have elsewhere suggested tbat when the pupil has got this
necessary knowledge, the master may be'gin ιο explain to him
the third book ol Ovid’s Metamorphoses, which contains little
more than simple propositions. The learning ol this or any
other easy bools will supply the boy with a large stock ol words,
the lirst necessity that hs has. The master must explain each
iesson sully to the boy, who will afterwards be examined in it,
aud required to give orally or to write on paper the Latin ¹lor
any word or any phrase in the lesson that the master may give

out in English; and when she lesson is well understood, the
