PREFAOE. xv

sonos and prepositions shall he exemplified; sod ii the boyie
thas made familiar with their use hythe examples of the best
authors, he will have conquered one oi the chief difficulties oi
the language. A hoy who has thus got a pretty good stoch oi
rords, a knowledge oi the structure ot' simple sentences, and oi
the use of the pronouns and prepositions, is ready to proceed
upon Ascharn’s method. It seems a kind oi truism tc state that
ο boysen only learn the Latin langrmge from the Latin authorsy
bot if the truth is trite, it is not the less necessary to snlorce it,
ior practically it is disregarded. By Latin authore l mean not
serape or detached sentences, but large consecutive pisces. lt
aboy could from the first begin, with the teacher's aid, to read
sLstin author, he ought to doit: but this is hardly possible,
end some preparation oi some kind must he msde; about ths
nature oi which preparation there may be differenca of opinion.
The examinatior of the forms of the words of a language
belongs to that division of grammar, which is'called etymology,
aterna which comprehende both the venetias of form which any
giren word may undergo, and also the relations ol words to
other kindred words. A true etymological examinatior] oi
words leads to a proper classification of them, to a determination ’

of their elementary parts or roots; and bys compar-ison of tha
various passages in which they occur, to a determination oi their
primary and recondary meanings. An examination oi the

various forms of nouus also leads to a better arrangement oi
their declensions⁹. By reducing each noun to its crude form,
thetis, to the form which it has when deprived oi the adjuncta
of csse, the learner perceives what is the true word and what is
the accident or modiiyiug part: thus ‘lapid'is the true word
lor ‘stone’ oi which ‘lapis,’ ‘lapidis,' ‘lapidibus’ are the word

with its accidence of case. 'l'he same remark applies to verbs: .

‘mona' is the verbal form, which hes its tenses, ‘moneo,'
‘monebam’ ‘monebu' formed by certain additions. The
element or root is generally a monosyllable, and sometimes must
he traced back through several forms before it can bc dis-
covered: as ‘tegmentorum’ ieads to the crude form ‘tegmenta'
which again leads to ‘tegmen 3⁹ and a comparison oi ‘ tegmen'
