When any part of a Roman writer isreadthemain
object of· the toacher is to explain the languag03 but for
this purpose, it is necessary sometimes to study the matter
also. From thir letter some notion may be got of the
Reman provincial administration. There is little use in
boys’ reading Roman history in the usual way in a short
sketoh or outline: they generally get as many false
notions as true. If the teaoher will take the paine to
master well each part of an author that he explains to his
pupils, his orel instruction on a subject of limited extent
will malso more impression on the pupils, and produoe
better results than the loose reading os the common his·
toties. With the view of helping a teaoher or diligent
student, I have added afew notes to the text of this letter.
Ihave used the notes in the Variorum edition, and the
commentary of P. Manutius ; but there is little in them.
For this second edition I have also used the notes in
K. F. Siipfle's ‘M. ‘llullii Oioeronis Epistolae Selectos:

Karlsruhe,1849; and I have sometimes found them
useful.
