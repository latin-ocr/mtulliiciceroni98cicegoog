Latin, is e direct obstacle to the acquisition oi this power. But
let ns return to Aschem.

The following passage is from the second book of the Sch0012
master: .

“After that your scholar, as I said before, shall come indeed,
first tc a ready persectness in translating, then toa ripe and
skilful choice in merking cut hir six ⁵points; es,

1. Proprium. 4. Contrarium.

2. Translatum. 5, Diversum.

³. synonymum. 6. Phreses.
'lhen take this order with him: read daily nnto him some book
of Tully, as the third book of Epistlee, chosen out by sturmius,
De Amicitia, De Senectute, or that excellent cpistlc containing
almost the whole first book Ad Q. Fratrem3 some comedy of
Terence or Plautus. But in Plautus skiltul choice must be used
by the master, to train his scholar to ajudgment in cutting out
perfectly over-old and improper words, Caesar's Commentaries
ere to be read with all curiosity, wherein especially (without all
exception to he made either by friend or foe) is seen the un·
spotted propriety of the Latin tongue, even when it was, as the
Grecians say, in ἀκμῇ, that ia, at the highest pitch of all perfect·
ness; or some orations oi T. Livius, such as be both longest end
plainest.

“These books 1 would have him reed now a good deal at
every lecture; for he shall not now use daily translation, but
only construe again, and perse, where ye suspect is any need:
yet let him not omit in these bools his former exercite, in
marking diligently, and writing orderly out of his six points;
and for transleting, use you yoursels every second or third day
to ohuse out some Epistle ad Atticum, some noteble common·
place out ol his Oratione, or some other part oi Tully by your
discretiori, which your scholar may not know where to find;
end translate it you yourselt' into plain natural English, end
then give it him to translate into Latin again, allowing him

good space and time to do it both with diligent heed and good ·
advisernent. ’
