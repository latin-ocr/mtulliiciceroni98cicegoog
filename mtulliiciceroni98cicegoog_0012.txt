PREFACE.

“Arraa the child heth learned perfectly the eight parts of
speech, let him then learn the right joining together of substan·
tises ssith adjectivae, the noun with the verb, the relative with
the antecedent. And in learning farther his syntaxis, by mine
advice, he shall not use the common order in common schools,
t'or making of Latines: whereby the child commonly learneth,
first, an evil choice of words¹ (and right choica of words, saith
Caesar, is the foundation of eloquence); then a wrong placing
oi words3 and, lastly, an ill traming of the sentence, with a
perverse judgment, both of words and sentences. These saulis,
taking once root in youth, be never, or hardly plucked away in
age. Moreover, there is no one thing, that heth more, either
‹lulled the wits, or: taken away the will of children from learning,
than the care they have to satisfy their masters in making of
Latines.

‘¹ For the scholar is commonly beat t’or the making, when the.
master were more worthy to be beat sor the mending, or rather
marriug os the same; the master many times being as ignorant
as the child, what to say properly and litly to the matter.

“Two schoolmasters have set forth in print, either of them a
book ol such kind of Latines¹, Hermen and Whittington. A
