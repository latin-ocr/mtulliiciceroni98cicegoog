that as the matter of an author creater a difficulty, a boy must
be first instructed in those authors or parts of authors, which
present the fawest difficulties for the matter, and are written in
an easy and simple style.

If teacbers of Latin knew that langnage as well es a good
toacher ofFrench or of any other modern tongue knows bis own
langnage, the teaehing of Latin would be comparatively easy.
And yet the usual methodo of tecching a modern langnage are
bad, and the amount that is learned is often small for the time
andlabour; and this, mainly because tenebere of foreign lan-
guages follow nearly the same methodo that are followed in
reaching Latin, many of which are bad. Amen may wish tolearn
a foreign language in order to be able to write it and speak it ς
but if he follow no other method than reading, he will never
accomplish his object. If he will first acquire the power ot
writing and speaking a langnage, he can easily leam to read it
The power of reading or translating a foreign langnage does nor
give the power of writing or speaking it, not even in the smalleo
degree, as all who have tn‘ed know by experienee. Amen may
have even a very exact knowledge of a foreign tongue for thr
purpose of reading end understandiog, and yet may be unable
to construet a single sentence or to utter a single phrase in con
versation; which proves that to learn to express a foreign lan
guage in our own tougue is only learning it under one aspect
and that to express our own langnage or our own ideas ir
another tongue is quite a different thing. Indead so differen
are the two things, that a person may leam by ear to speak r
medem language fluently, and yet he may have only a sligh
knowledge of it; for the langnage of common conversation i
very limited. lf he has learned to write the langnage so as t
express himself with ease on the ordinary matters of life, as i:
a letter or the like, he will have a greater command of the lan
guage3 but even then, his knowledge will be superficial witbon
a careful study of the best writers.

lt is true that the writing of exercises isone of the means no*

employed for the teaching of medem langnages, but the writin
of axercises' may be 'an impediment to learning a languagr
The method of the exereises may be as bad and as ill adepte
to the object, es it would be for a man to leam a foreign tongu
