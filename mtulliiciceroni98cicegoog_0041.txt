If a small part os Cicero, well learned, is sufficient ιο lay the
foundation ofa good knowledge of the Latin language, it ia
necessary ιο show that every particular usage, which is an essem

In selectirg matter for notes which must he oi limited extent,
there is no rule thet can be laid down. The object is to help
the reader tu understand the author, but rome readers require

The first book of Letters is intended for young studente, to

⁴ make them familiar with the ordinary epistolary style oi the

Latin language. They should he learned so thoroughly theta
boy should know every form of expression in them. The matter
will cause little difficulty3 the teaoher’s explanation and my few
notes will be enough for that purpose. The shorter epistles oi
Cicero, those written in a careless manner, as one may say, are
a good introduction to Terence, for they come near ιο tha style
oi conversation. The second book os Letters, which contains
longer and more elaborate epistlee, is adapted for those who
have made more proliciency. The long epistla to Quintus, being
more iu the oratorical style, will serve as an introduction ιο the
orations of Cicero· The prose language oi the Romans should

be learned irom Caesar, Terence, and the easier parts of Cicero,
which will furnish ample material t'or the first few years of e
student'a course. The reading of other writers and of Cicero's
Oratione should be deferred till the pupil has mastered the Latin
langnage well in the purest and simplest form, and where it ir
eneumbered with few difficulties oi matter.
