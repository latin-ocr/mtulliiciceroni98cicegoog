39. CICERO TREBATIO.
(v11. 7. a. u c 700.)

Ego te commendare non desisto ; sed quid proficiam ex te
seire cupio. Spem maximam habeo in Balbo ad quem de
te diligentissime et saepissime scribe. Illud soleo mirari,
non me toties accipere tuas literas quoties a Quinto mihi
fratre afferantur. InBritannia nihil esse audio neque auri
neque argenti. Id si ita est, essedum aliquod oapias
suadeo, et ad nos quam primum recurras. Sin autem sine
Britannia tamen assequi quod volumus possumus, perfice
ut sis in familiaribus Caesaris. Multum te in eo frater
adjurabit meus, multum Balbus; sed, mihi crede, tuus
pudor et labor plurimum. Imperatorem liberalissimum,
aetatem opportunissimam, commendationem certe singu·
larani, ut tibi unum timendum ait ue ipse tibi defuisse
videare.
