ought, plain, and easy, tho scholar is always labouring with
pleasure, and ever going right on forward with profit. Always
hbonring 1 say; for, or he have construed‚ parsed, twice trans·
hted over by good advisement, marked out his six points by
rkilful judgment, he shall heve necessary occasion to read over
every lecture a doaen times at the least. Which because he
shall do alwaye in order, he shall do it always with pleasure.
‘llud pleasure allureth love, love heth lust to labour, labour
always obtaineth his purpose3' as most truly both Aristotle in
his Rhetoriclr, and Oedipus in Sophocles do teach, saying τὸ

following of that good counsel which Pliny doth give to his
friend Fuscus, eayiug, ‘Multum non multa⁸.’ But to my pur-

according as Aphthoniue⁹ beginneth his exercises of learning,
aud let him fraudate it into Latin again, abiding in such place,
where no other scholar may prompt him. But yet use you
yourself such discretior for choice therein, as the matter may bc
within the compass, both for words and sentences, of his former
learning and reading. And now take heed, lest your scholar do
not better' ιιι come point than you yourself, except ye have been
diligently exerclsed m these kinds of manslating before.
