exercises and the tales in the manner which the author recom=
mande, is able to write and spealr the German language, andtt
read an easy author. The method requires perseverancc, regu
lar-ity, and some time; but if it is followed as MnWitticl
directe, any boy of ordinary capacity will have acquired thu
command over the German language which very few possess
,Ι do not believe that any system of writing Latin exercises nov
in use would produce a similar result; and yet it is eaaier tv
leam to write Latin, aa well as a modern cen learn to write it
than taleam to write German ⁸.

Latin might be learned in the same way, if ateacber hed a
great command over it, as a German has over his own language
but this is impossible, and some other way must be attempted
A teacber’s knowledge of Latin is founded on a few Latii
authors, and his own judgment is no authority; he must alway
appeal to his originale. It is therefore necessary tbat the Latu
language must be learned from Latin authors, who fumish th
matter of tha language both for the teacher and the ieamer
The direct object is not to leam to write Latina it ia to be abl
to read tbe authors with ease, and the means of accomplishin
thia must be some method that shall attain the object, auda
the same time be a good discipline for the learner. A goo
' discipline has not only the advantage of being good aa a disc
pline, but it will secure the object which ue have in view. r
bad discipline will generally fail altogether; and those wb
leem in spite of it, throw away much of tbeir time and labour
they learn much which, aa hachem says, they will afterwards b
glad to unlearn.

Ascham’s metbod supposes a certain amount of knowledgv
buthe does not explain how this is to be acquired. A boy mur
in some way master the various forms of decienaion aud conjv
gation. He may do it by committing them to memory au
writiug out exampies on paper. This isa dull and tireaome tasl

⁶ Mr. Wittich's new metbod of learning a modern languege was iir
explained by himself in the Journal of Educadou, vol. iv. p. 209. Η
method is further explained iu bis “German for Beginnem or, Progressi*
Exerciaes in the German Language‚⁸' third edition, London, lut-53 and 1
