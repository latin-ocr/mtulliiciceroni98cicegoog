178 CICERONIS EPISTOLARUM LIBRI DUO.

velue, 010 worth reading as specimens 01 the excellent
practica] knowledge 01 1101111 which most of the writers
had. The letters of Jewell are almost faultlese, and very
lively and amusing. ’

The only difficulties in these letters 01 010010 arise
either from particular words or from the general matter. ἵ
I have briefly explained a few 01 those terma which puzzle κ

alearner, or even a teacher who has not turned his ,
attention particularly 10 the letters of Cicero and to the ¹
technicel terms whioh‘frequently occur in them. As to 1
the matter, I have done enough to show what the 1011010
010 about, when such information was necessary 3 and by
putting those to the same person together, I have some·
what diminished a difficulty which is inherent in all
epistolary correspondence. Though the 1011010 were se-
lected aolely 101 the langnage, I have chosen such as help
to explain one another3 and a reader will find that, when
he has got through a few, he will have lesa trouble with
11101001. I have taken many 01111000 10 111ος and indeed
the whole book of letters to Tiro might have been well
placed here. They are of the familiar affectionate kind,
turn upon 0 few matters, of which Tiro’s poor health is
one; and they show the amiable side 01 the family of the
Ciceros in their attachment to a faithful servant. Setting
aside the difficulty of the matter, «which in these lettersis
not great, there ia no Latin author read in schools, either

language of these letters.

. I have given the dates 1. a. o. 01110101101000 they 010
given in Orelli’s edition3 but a few 01 the dates are 1101
certain. I have used the 110100 01 P. Manutius and those
inthe Variorum edition3 and some of those in Stipfle’s
collection, 101 I happened to select several letters that
he has selected, and before I saw his book.
